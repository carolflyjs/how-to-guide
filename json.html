            <p class="content">You are creating your own website about Chinese action movie stars like Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. You decided to provide your visitors with information of their movies. While you do not want to send them away to other sites like IMDB, you are still hoping to take advantage of their data.

            <p class="content">If this story sounds somewhat familiar, you are looking for the solution of "API." But firstly, <strong>what is API?</strong></p>
            <p class="content">Like many others, your search landed you onto <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">Wikipedia</a> where API is defined as "a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software and applications." It is a rather technical, boring and somewhat scary definition. But relax, API is fun and not difficult at all. Let's start with the concept of <strong>interface</strong>. </p>

On the date, you asked her questions about her job and family and made a hit! A successful first date!</p>
            <p class="content">Believe it or not, making API connections is just like a first date. Only that instead of two human beings, it involves two applications. They meet at a <strong>URI address</strong> (the Four Barrel Coffee), with <strong>identity information</strong> (the red book) and some <strong>queries</strong> of interest (job and family questions).</p>
